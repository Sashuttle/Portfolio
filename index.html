        <h2 class="x">About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Samantha Shuttleworth and I am new to Full Stack Web Development.  My most recent job I was a Service Writer for a local mechanic shop. I learned a great deal about cars while working there and I formed close relationships with coworkers and customers. Before that position, I was a Document Specialist for GEICO. I worked thirteen hour shifts and was constantly on my feet running industrial printers or mail inserting machines. I enjoyed both positions, but I was looking to do something different.</p>
        <p>I have always wanted to learn to code and design, so I felt it was time to finally pursue this field. So in December of 2023 I applied for the University of Texas Full Stack Bootcamp. I am excited to continue my education with this course and develop new skills for my future career in this field.</p>
