# Portfolio Coding Project

## Description
Module 2 Challenge which implements HTML and Advanced CSS to create a Professional Portfolio. This includes making the website fit on smaller screens like phones, having pictures linked to websites, different design styles through CSS.

## Features
The html code has semantics to help with better flow and organization making the code easier to understand. 
The code is clean and well structured.
My project design is compatable on different screen sizes.
I have acknowledged images I was able to use from artists and mentioned people who helped me on this project.
